Generics allow you to write flexible and reusable functions, types, and protocols that can work with a variety of data types. 
They enable you to create code that is abstracted from specific types and promotes code reusability, type safety, and maintainability.

Here are the key aspects and features of generics:

1. Type Parameters:
Generics in Swift use type parameters, which are placeholders for actual types. 
Type parameters are specified within angle brackets (<>) and can have any valid name. 
They allow you to define functions, structures, classes, and protocols that operate on different types.

2. Type Constraints:
Generics can include type constraints to restrict the types that can be used with the generic code. 
Type constraints define requirements on the type parameters, such as requiring them to conform to a specific protocol or to be a subclass of a certain class.

3. Generic Types:
Generics can also be used to create generic types, such as generic structures and classes, which can work with multiple types. 
This allows you to define reusable components that adapt to different data types.

Generics provide several benefits in iOS development:

Code Reusability: Generics allow you to write flexible code that can be reused with different types, reducing the need for duplicate code.
Type Safety: Generics provide compile-time type checking, ensuring that the correct types are used with generic code.
Abstraction: Generics enable you to write generic algorithms, data structures, and protocols that can work with a wide range of types, promoting abstraction and modularity.

// Example 1:
// A good demostration of Genearics is Result enum.
// I will recreate the enum and use it

enum Result<T, E: Error> { // In this line we define an Generic type enum named Result which contains T,E as a types and E has a Type constrain.
    // In each case we will have a param with one of the types
    case success(T) 
    case failure(E)
}

func fetchData() -> Result<String, Error> { // This function returns a Result type var which contains string in case of sucess and error in case of fail
    // Simulating a successful data fetch
    let data = "Hello, World!"
    return .success(data)
}

let result = fetchData()

switch result {
case .success(let data):
    print("Data: \(data)")

case .failure(let error):
    print("Error: \(error)")
}

// Example 2
// Stack is a Genearic Type
// It has a Type Constrain : Comparable
// And uses a Type Parameter T, but you need to define it in initing

struct Stack<T: Comparable> {

    init(getElements: [T]) {
        elements = getElements 
    }
    private var elements: [T] = []
    
    mutating func push(_ element: T) {
        elements.append(element)
    }
    
    mutating func pop() -> T? {
        return elements.popLast()
    }
    
    mutating func biggest() -> T? {
        return elements.max()
    }
    
}


func swap<T: Comparable>(_ a: inout T, _ b: inout T) {
    let temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp
}

var a: Stack<Int> = Stack(getElements: [])
a.push(3)
a.push(5)

print(a)
print(a.biggest()!)
// var x = "3"
// var y = "a"

// print(x)
// print(y)

// swap(&x,&y)

// print(x)
// print(y)
